Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore</p>

<p>
  We won't hesitate
  To break down the garden gate
  There's not much time left today
  Life is a highway
  I wanna ride it all night long
  If you're going my way
  I wanna drive it all night long</p>
<p>
  Through all these cities and all these towns
  It's in my blood, and it's all around
  I love you now like I loved you then
  This is the road, and these are the hands
  From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
  The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
  Knock me down and back up again
  You're in my blood; I'm not a lonely man</p>

<p>
  There's no load I can't hold
  A road so rough this I know
  I'll be there when the light comes in
  Tell 'em we're survivors
  Life is a highway
  I wanna ride it all night long
  If you're going my way
  I wanna drive it all night long
  Life is a highway
  I wanna ride it all night long
  If you're going my way
  I wanna drive it all night long
  There was a distance between you and I
  A misunderstanding once
  But now we look in the eye
  There ain't no load that I can't hold
  A road so rough this I know
  I'll be there when the light comes in
  Tell 'em we're survivors/p>
