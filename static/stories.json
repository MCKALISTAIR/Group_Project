​
Paul Gray, Programme Leader for BA (Hons) Film, is the writer and director of the film, which was in production in Summer 2015. Filming is now complete and is currently being edited at Edinburgh Napier in the post production facilities at Screen Academy Scotland.
​
The film production formed a hub of creative work-related learning opportunities for students from the School of Arts and Creative Industries.  Not least for Hana Mackenzie, who is currently in her final year of BA (Hons) Acting for Stage and Screen and who plays the lead role of Violet. Hana was awarded a paid placement over the summer so that she could concentrate on the film.
Director Paul Gray says “I met Hana on the recommendation of Edinburgh Napier acting tutor Ian Dunn during casting for the role of Violet, and it was instantly clear that Hana has a very special talent. From the first audition, Hana made the role her own and it immediately became very difficult to imagine anyone else playing Violet.",

From the first audition, Hana made the role her own and it immediately became very difficult to imagine anyone else playing Violet.

I contacted the Placement and Careers Office to discuss the possibility of offering an acting placement that would not only allow the opportunity to work with Hana on developing the role of Violet but that would also offer experience and insight in to the casting and pre-production processes, in which Hana was very much involved.”

​And Violet was a micro budget film shoot, developed with the support of the charity Scottish Adoption, and that was funded in part by crowd funding. BA (Hons) Acting and English student Catherine Exposito also benefited from a paid placement on the production as a Marketing and Crowd Funding Intern.",
"para3": "Paul explains, “Catherine came on board the production with a great understanding of social media and was an immense help in maintaining the momentum of our crowd funding campaign. While we didn’t quite hit our funding target, we successfully raised enough to complete our filming schedule, so overall we were extremely pleased.”

​“I was very keen to create opportunities for students to gain first hand experience of working on a feature film, so wherever possible, we tried to make work-related learning opportunities available. Outwith the funded placements, we also offered opportunities in the production, camera and art departments on the shoot. In total around 30 Edinburgh Napier students from the subject areas of Film, Photography, Acting and Design benefited from being involved in the production. I also got to collaborate with a number of Edinburgh Napier graduates, most significantly with cinematographer Alkisti Terzi, who studied film here as both an undergraduate and postgraduate student.

I think it's given me more confidence in terms of my ability to help people and knowing that I have quite a lot to offer as a graduate.

Companies like British Airways, or Tesco's, have their own in house magazines that are generally published by an external contract publisher. So if you work for one of these companies, you end up writing on multiple subjects across multiple magazines, in different tones and different styles, which was really appealing to me as someone who wants to write.",

She was able to secure a place with Think thanks to the strong links Edinburgh Napier has with the publishing industry.",

Avril Gray, the course leader, is very well connected and she works really hard to network throughout the year to ask different companies if they would be prepared to take students on as a placement. She's great at always sending out opportunities that are advertised. When Think advertised, I put an application in and was thankfully successful. As soon as I saw it, I just grabbed the opportunity.",

Joanna goes on to tell us. “John Innes, Head of Think’s Scotland Office, came to give a lecture to us, and I was pretty blown away by his attitude. He was very positive about how effective magazines are, especially in a time where you hear a lot of tales of tragedy that print is dying out.
  It was really refreshing to hear that he was so positive and forward thinking. They were taking more and more clients on, generating more and more business across print and online, so it was a really exciting prospect working with them.
  The placement was also an opportunity for Joanna to build her career prospects for the future. I really wanted to get my foot in the door. she says. While I'm in my 30's, most people on the course are in their 20's. I'd already had a career in libraries and wanted a change. One of the reasons I chose Edinburgh Napier is because they offer placements, and I thought that would be a really good way to give me actual real-time experience in industry, which would benefit me in the long run.
  Since completing her studies in 2014, Joanna now works in social media and web content for an events firm, while also working in a freelance role with Edinburgh Tourism. In the future, she’s hoping to continue in to the field of contract publishing. Eventually I would like to have a position in a contract publisher. That would be the goal, because I like the idea of working with that kind of variety and the challenge of having to write for ten different magazines. I like that, it appeals to me a lot.

  The students worked with individuals receiving support from the charity to develop their photography skills by exploring the city and surrounding area to capture images of various landmarks including, The Royal Botanic Gardens, The Scottish Parliament and Arthur’s Seat.
  The project aimed to help those involved develop their technical photograhy skills and learn more about the city. For Sam, Daniella and Kirsty, it was an opportunity to gain teaching and project management experience whilst contributing to a valuable social project.
  The participants, coming from a wide range of countries including Sudan, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Columbia and Spain were encouraged to use what they had captured to help them convey what moving to the city had meant to them and to share personal stories of being new to both the city and Scotland as a whole.
  Discussions on culture shock, the language barrier, interactions with people and even the weather were all stimulated through the project, helping individuals form new friendships alongside finding common ground in their experiences.",
  "para2":"Lindsay Morgan, Placement Coordinator for Edinburgh Napier’s, School of Arts and Creative Industries commented: “The project was created as an opportunity for community engagement and a chance for our students to gain real pedagogical and project management experience. Language barriers and social isolation are common amongst refugees and migrants and by creating a visual record, we hoped to transcend these barriers.
  “Over the past few years, our photography programme has organised several volunteer projects for students and we’re delighted that we’ve been able to work on another great project with a local charity that carries out so much fantastic work within our city. The benefits really have been felt by all those involved.”
  The Welcoming supports refugees and migrants in Edinburgh, with over 1,000 people from 60 different nationalities benefitting from its range of classes, activities and workshops each year. Its aim is to help Scotland benefit from the diversity, experiences and talents that its participants bring.
  Elaine Mowat, deputy director of The Welcoming, said: “The project has been an amazing opportunity for our participants to learn new skills, explore the city from new perspectives and benefit from the expertise and enthusiasm of the Edinburgh Napier students. This is exactly the kind of experience that helps newcomers feel welcome and included, and to see Edinburgh as a place where they can succeed in building an exciting new life. We are delighted to have had the opportunity to work with the University and really appreciate all the support that its School of Arts & Creative Industries has provided.”"

On my work placements, the duties, company culture and locations were very distinct from each other, yet I gained both personal and professional growth after each experience. Work placements look great on your CV and my experience has dramatically increased my employability. Now, I won’t be considered as just a graduate, but also as a graduate developer with more than a year’s relevant experience. This is so important in this competitive and ever evolving industryThe support I received from the University was very valuable. At the beginning of the year, I arranged a meeting with a CV advisor, took part in a mock interview and received warm congratulations when I was offered a placement. A well-structured CV was the main factor for why I was selected for interview, so it’s worth taking some time to seek out the right advice and highlight your best skills."

I was very lucky to be working with a supportive team that felt like a small family by the end of the placement."

  Kate's advice to you!, So, for those of you who are thinking of whether going for a placement or not I say – Yes! In addition to gaining real work experience, this placement year can help you realise what exactly you like doing in your field. It helps to understand what kind of working environment suits you more (whether it’s a start-up or a big corporate company with a defined hierarchy) and generally what kind of worker you are.

  "para2": "I completed my placement year at Caterpillar Inc. down in Bournemouth, England. The year was an experience, I wouldn’t take back for anything! I made so many great friends whilst also gaining practical work experience that I didn’t think would quite be possible on a placement year. The work was demanding, but more than anything it was relevant and interesting. I worked on multiple projects that will impact the business for years to come and I hope to stay in contact with Caterpillar as I progress through my studies. Caterpillar offered me many ways of expanding my knowledge during my time with them. One notable course was the lean business practice course, as well as a multitude of online resources to self-train with.
  The biggest thing I got out of my year with them was the unbelievable amount of business knowledge I left with. I entered with virtually zero knowledge and anytime there was a meeting or online presentation regarding the business I attended it. I want to take this chance to thank Caterpillar again for just an incredible year and letting me work for them and their historic business.
  Gregor offers this advice to students considering whether or not to take part in a work placement. Do it! Honestly, as difficult or daunting as it may seem it will be one of the best things you ever do. I can only think of positives when looking back on my year at Caterpillar and I do not believe I would be the same person without that company or my time on placement. Also, look for opportunities outside of Scotland because there are some truly incredible placements out there waiting for a student and why can’t that student be you?
  Finally, I want to pass on a bit of advice a former placement student gave to me, this placement will be whatever you make it, you can choose to do the minimal amount or you can choose to take every chance and immerse yourself fully with the job, so make the most of it."

  "para": "Maxime Garcia’s first choice was Edinburgh Napier when he decided he wanted to leave his native France to study abroad. “I wanted to explore somewhere else and Scotland just seemed like a natural choice for me, you know?” he says. “I completed the equivalent of an HND in France then I had the opportunity to come here. I wanted to have international experience and Edinburgh is an eclectic city, it is tiny, but incredibly interesting to me.”",
  "para2": "It wasn’t just the Edinburgh lifestyle, however, that attracted Max to the capital. As a BSc (Hons) Civil and Timber Engineering student, it was the career opportunities he’d have access to in Scotland that drew him in. “Scotland, you know, it has... something pulling me towards it. Scotland has incredible natural resources, they’re huge. The trees that will be grown sustainably over the next decade will be enough to create 3 million houses to build in the UK or to export.”",
  "para3": "Max, who completed his degree in 2014 and since returned to study a part-time Masters course, made the most of every opportunity he had at Edinburgh Napier to further his career prospects. This included jumping at the chance to undertake a summer internship with CarbonLite Design and Build, a timber construction company in Invergordon, just north of Inverness.",
  "para4": "“I was offered the placement after I did my honours dissertation under the supervision of Robert Hairstans, who is the Head of the Centre for  Offsite Construction and Innovative Structures, or COCIS. He helped motivate me to undertake an internship with the company as he was collaborating with the company on the development of innovative structures using local timber. COCIS is based at Edinburgh Napier, which is part of the Institute for Sustainable Construction. It's a pretty successful institute, and that’s because they have so many links with the industry.”",
  "para5": "COCIS and the Institute of Sustainable Construction (ISC) are organisations in the School of Engineering and the Built Environment at Edinburgh Napier, which work closely with companies in the engineering and construction industries in Scotland to produce world-leading and valuable research in to the challenges facing the industry. As a benefit of the connection, students like Max often have the opportunity to go on placement with companies in the field.",
  "para6": "“The organisations are  really active in developing these new innovative systems, trying to link the industrial part of it - the research - and put it into context.” says Max about their work. “If you have the research and you keep it all to yourself, then what's the point? But here, at Edinburgh Napier, for me it's really important that everything they do is based on what the industry requires and on how to improve it. Edinburgh Napier supports the industry, and the industry supports the University. It's like a closed circuit.”",
  "para7": "These kinds of valuable links to the industry are one of the key benefits of the practical skills-focussed outlook Edinburgh Napier has. Max, who’s since returned to CarbonLite after his summer placement while studying for his Masters, says the close relationship between the University and industry is beneficial for everyone. “In the Timber industry, we’re not trying to compete with each other, we all want to elevate each other. It's all driven by opportunities and skills transfer, and with my company, because of the links that we have and because I'm still a student, we get advice on everything I do from the COCIS. They really aim all their work to help the industry evolve, because we all share the same vision. We will get there. We're not at the stage where we don't really know what to do, we know where we want to get to and it's happening, thanks to COCIS.”",
  "para8": "“I don't know what to say to express how helpful Edinburgh Napier has been. It's more than just an opportunity, it's more than just creating a link. It's like creating a connection and then following it through to success, and by success, I mean taking timber construction to the next stage.”",
  "para9": "As with all the students featured on ENhance, Max also summed up his placement in three words. Well, he certainly attempted to keep it to just three!",
  "quote": "“I would say sustainable. It's the only word I would use, because sustainable means viable, durable and environmental, and these three words make sustainable. So (laughing) there you go!”"
